Brief Summary;
  In Task 1, I created a file named arrayManipulation and created an array of numbers and returned either the square or triple of each number depending on
  whether it was even or odd into a different array.
  In Task 2, I created an array of strings and if returned array from Task1 was even, I capitalise the entire string else i converted it into lowercases.
  In Task 3, I created a new file named userInfo and created an array of names and for each name, a modified name from Task2 and an ID was given.
